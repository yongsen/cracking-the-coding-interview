## how to prepare
1. solve the problem on your own.
2. write the code on paper.
3. test your code.
4. type your paper code as-is into a computer.

## what you need to know
* data structures, algorithms, and concepts
* powers of 2 table

## walking through a problem
1. listen carefully
2. draw an example
3. state a brute force
4. optimize
5. walk through
6. implement
7. test

## optimize & solve technique #1
